### Hi there | Hola ðŸ‘‹

I am Harold Ruiz, althoug new to developing world, I am a quick learner, and I am currently practicing a lot, working on different tutorials (youtube, twitter, linkedin), 
including JS, React, Python and more. Just finished a  Full Stack Software Developer bootcamp @4GeeksAcademy and finishing another one from Udemy, 
I believe kowledge comes from both, sharing and trying!

I am working on different public/practice projects at the time, in order to master the basics, and get ready for real life challenges.

Willing to learn about Python, Vue, React. My passion is for logics, automation, serving and developing, of course!

Wann know about me?

- Life-balance is a must nowadays, I am willing to work remote, and/or locally if it is in Bogota; altough, I could travel from time to time
- I would love to callaborate on real life projects, challenges and more
