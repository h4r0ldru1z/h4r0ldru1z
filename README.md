<h1><strong>Hi there | Hola 👋</h1>

I am Harold Ruiz, although new to developing world, I am a quick learner, and I am currently practicing a lot, working on different tutorials (youtube, twitter, linkedin), 
including JS, React, Python and more. Just finished a  Full Stack Software Developer bootcamp @4GeeksAcademy and finishing another one from Udemy, 
I believe knowledge comes from both, sharing and trying!

I am working on different public/practice projects at the time, in order to master the basics, and get ready for real life challenges.
