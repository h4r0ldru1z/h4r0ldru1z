### Hi there | Hola 👋

I am Harold Ruiz, although new to developing world, I am a quick learner, and I am currently practicing a lot, working on different tutorials (youtube, twitter, linkedin), 
including JS, React, Python and more. Just finished a  Full Stack Software Developer bootcamp @4GeeksAcademy and finishing another one from Udemy, 
I believe kowledge comes from both, sharing and trying!

I am working on different public/practice projects at the time, in order to master the basics, and get ready for real life challenges.

Willing to learn about Python, Vue, React. My passion is for logics, automation, serving and developing, of course!
